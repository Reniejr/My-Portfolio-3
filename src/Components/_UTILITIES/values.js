    Hi,
    My name is Renie Jr, I am a Full Stack Developer graduated in Strive School.
    Before Strive School I did not have any coding experience, but after this journey I can absolutely confirm that I am a real developer.
    Born and actually based in Roma, Italia knowing also as "La CittÃ  Eterna" or "Caput Mundi" and of course I am Romano DOC 100%.
    Beside coding I really love sports like football, american football, basketball etc... and sometime I practice combat sports like boxing and krav maga with my friends.
    I really hope you will enjoy this my presentation.

    In my job career I have worked as bartender, for almost 2 years, where I learnt how to interact with people and of course how to make cocktails.
    As a pizza-maker, job that I loved because i love pizza, but I cannot do any tricks on making it.
    And now I am looking for a job position as a web developer.

    "Never Stop Learning",
    this is my motto, not only about job career but even in life in general.
    After Strive School, I do not want to stop my coding journey, so I set some targets that I want to reach for now:
    1. Master canvas.
    2. 3D web rendering (with three.js).
    3. Improve my cyber-security skills.
